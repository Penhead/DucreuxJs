# DucreuxJs
Simple Frontend Utility Framework. 

This framework was created to help with normal frontend tasks such as validation, simple elem querying, custom directives, element height equalizer, videoBox (only for self hosted videos at the moment), simple UI masking, geolocation.

Still in very experimental state will be streamlined and new features added soon.
